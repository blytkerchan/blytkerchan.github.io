In his article "[Five Reasons Google Chrome OS Will Fail](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/168058/five_reasons_google_chrome_os_will_fail.html)", David Coursey argues that Microsoft is simply too powerful in the OS market for any new OS to succeed. His collegue, Jared Newman, argues in "[Five Reasons Google Chrome OS Will Succeed](http://www.pcworld.com/article/182743/five_reasons_google_chrome_os_will_succeed.html)" that Google is so well-known and well-loved that it will surely succeed, and will help (if not cause) a market shift, moving a large part of the PC-owning population to Netbooks. Neither of them look at what [Google promises with Google Chrome OS](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html):

- speed
- reliability
- low-cost

None of these are good enough reasons to move to a different OS, for most of us: most of us do not work on the web on a day-to-day basis. I know _you_ are probably currently on the web (how else would you be reading my blog) as am _I_ (how else would I be writing it - actually, any number of ways, but that's beside the point). Desktop systems are used all around the world for a large number of things, including, _**but certainly not limited to**_ web browsing and using on-line applications.

Does that mean that Google is missing the boat? I don't think so. I'm assuming that they _know_ that most people (probably including themselves) don't work on the web _all the time_. I, for one, am perhaps on-line most of the time, but am certainly not using a web browser most of the time. I would _assume_, therefore, that even if the OS doesn't come with a developers toolkit and word processor pre-installed, that doesn't mean they can't be installed. Hopefully, X (either Xorg or XFree) will run on Google Chrome OS, which means so will by far most applications based on gtk or Qt

I agree with most of the premises Google bases Chrome on - which is probably why I use it if I can: the web browser should stay out of the way as much as possible, have as little of a GUI as possible, and be as fast and secure as possible. Chrome (the browser), however, doesn't lack any features that a browser needs (except perhaps a good Java plugin). I'm assuming that the Google Chrome OS won't lack any necessities either - but I might be assuming too much.
