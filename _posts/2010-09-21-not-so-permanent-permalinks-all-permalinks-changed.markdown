Due to the addition of an important feature on the site, all permalinks for all posts have changed. Following the old links will send you to an error page where the the proposed options should include the page you're looking for.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

**2010-09-28**: to make sure everything continues to work, I'll be using less pretty, but more effective permalinks as per the default of the blogging engine, from now on. Only one additional permalink is broken with this change, but it does actually fix a few bugs, so I guess I'll live with the one broken link.

Again, sorry for the inconvenience, but if all goes well, things will get _more_ convenient from here on.
