I will be moving my open source projects (yes, all of them) to GitHub.

<!--more-->

This will be a bit of a gradual process, as some of the projects are rather old and have been defunct for a while.

The reasons are simple: between the Git-based options, GitHub turns out to be the one that provides the features I want, including basic ticket tracking. Inside the VPN, we use Request Tracker for that (moving to Traq), but I can't make that a reliable outward-facing solution with the (rather unreliable) Internet connection I have.

Gitorious was actually my first choice, but it doesn't have an issue tracker. Rolling a front-end to RT or Traq crossed my mind for a few minutes, but is too involved for what I want.

I'll post updates as things move along, in case you're interested.
