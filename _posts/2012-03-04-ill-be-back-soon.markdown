Those of you who have been following this blog or the podcast may be wondering why I've been silent lately. The answer to that is simple: lack of sleep. My baby boy is starting to sleep nights, though, and some time should hopefully clear in my schedule to pick up the podcast where I left it, and to write some more posts on this blog. In the mean time: patience is a virtue -- and sleep an under-rated commodity.
