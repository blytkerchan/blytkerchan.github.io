I changed my hosting provider a few days ago, which implied changing the DNS provider as well. As a result of this - and my forgetting to set the MX entry correctly, the mail service for landheer-cieslak.com was down. [Michel](http://michelf.ca) was kind enough to notify me of this, so it's been fixed this morning.
