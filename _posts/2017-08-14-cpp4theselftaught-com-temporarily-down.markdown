The C++ for the self-taught site is temporarily down for "unscheduled maintenance" (i.e. a bug).

I haven't had time to look into fixing it yet: I just found out it was misbehaving about an hour ago, during my routine check of my websites. I'll try to fix it tonight and update this post when I have news. 

If you want to help out: you could donate to my BitCoin address 1JE9wominCU1mw1JtD7JWu8vfYfcGQ9pKj.

**Update (21:58 EDT): **
An automatic updates seems to have bugged out and left the site inoperable. According to the logs this happened sometime during my vacation. The site looks OK now -- please let me know if you see anything awry.
