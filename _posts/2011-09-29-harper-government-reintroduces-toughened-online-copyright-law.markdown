In the Vancouver Sun: bill C-32 from last session has been re-introduced (probably with some modification -- I haven't had a chance to read the bill yet) and is far more likely to pass, now that there's a conservative majority in Parliament.

**Update Oct 8, 2008:** the re-introduced Copyright Modernization Act is numbered C-11, and is available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20111221034832/http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=5134851&Language=E&Mode=1).
