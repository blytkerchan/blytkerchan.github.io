A revised history of the Manchester Baby, in two parts, by B. Jack Copeland from the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, is available [here](http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.2010.1) and [here](http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.2010.2) -- a really 
interesting read.
