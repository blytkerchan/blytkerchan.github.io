Since concepts got "yanked" from C++0x (see [my post on the subject](/blog/2009/07/no-concepts-in-c0x/)) I've been keeping a closer watch on comp.std.c++ than I usually do.

Aside from generic meta-programming and threading, one feature I really like about C++ is its ability to do functional programming. Lambda expressions are, of course, a favorite when doing functional programming - though currently C++ doesn't allow them very elegantly. In [this post](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.c++/browse_thread/thread/364c4bd6dfb8e628), Mathias Gaunard proposes polymorphic lambdas be put back in C++0x. How much fun could we have with that?!
