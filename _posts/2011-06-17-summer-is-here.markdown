[Summer is here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer#Timing), so it's time to update desktop backgrounds and site headers with something a bit more summery.

This wallpaper of course has the Vlinder logo and the url of this website but, more prominently, it has a lily flower - which also figures prominently (but stylized) on the flag of the Canadian province I live in.

Links to download the wallpaper are wrapped around the image. There are two sizes: 1680*1050 and 1024*768.

The photo on which the flower image is based was found on a site for architecture ideas called thisarchitecture.com.
