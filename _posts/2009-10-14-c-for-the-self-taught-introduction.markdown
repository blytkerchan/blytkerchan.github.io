title: 'C++ for the self-taught: Introduction'
wordpress_id: 268

I've decided to take a little time to make use of those 20000+ hours of C++ I have under my belt and make life a bit easier on those of you that are learning C++. In order to do that, I have created a new category called "C++ for the self-taught" that will basically show you how to program in C++.

<!--more-->

I will touch on managed C++ (C++/CLI) as well as standard C++, but the focus will be on standard C++. The approach will be one through which you will learn C++ directly as a programming language in and of itself - not as a beefed-up derivative of C or as a predecessor of Java. We will dive directly into the C++ programming language and forgo the usual detour of "learning C before you learn C++".

We will rely heavily on free software: you will be expected to have either [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe) on Windows, or some Linux distribution. Example code will have been compiled on Cygwin and Debian Lenny, with G++ version 3.4 and 4.4.

Vlinder Software is footing the bill for hosting my blog, and will also foot the bill for hosting the podcast and a new E-mail address for C++ questions: cppquestions@vlinder.ca. What I say in the podcast will be exactly what I write on the blog, so you choose to either listen to me reading it, or read it yourself (or both). Of course, I won't spell out the examples in the podcast.

These posts will also be heavily based on examples, some of which, in turn, will use free software. Some of the free software used will be software provided by Vlinder Software, but not all of it.

Here are some of the notions I intend to touch upon, in no particular order:

- threads
- XML
- object-oriented design
- RAII
- secure programming in C++
- templates
- design patterns
- networking

but we'll start out with the basics: syntax, grammar and "Hello, world!".

If you have any questions, feel free to ask by either sending a message to the address above, or leaving a comment here.
