A bit quicker than expected - but that's always a good thing.

We're tesing a new host OS: the Git server - just like most other servers we run - is a VM running a Linux flavor running on a system which is (now) running a different Linux flavor. The intent is to make the server a bit more responsive and to make better use of the available hardware. We'll re-evaluate in a month or so, when we've gathered some statistics on this new running system. By that time, we might move to another host OS again, or move to a different physical host.

I just have to say this, though: it only took 27 minutes to install and set up the new host OS, and we didn't lose any data - ain't modern software just great?
