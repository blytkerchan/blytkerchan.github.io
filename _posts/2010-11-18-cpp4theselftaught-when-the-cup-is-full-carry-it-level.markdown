It is both a problem and a privilege to have too much work. It is a problem because, at some point, things don't get done and it is a privilege because it means, among other things, that people are trusting you with things to do.

The C++ for the self-taught podcast, however, is one of the things I am not getting done this time. I will, therefore, have to revert to the original, monthly, schedule for the time being, while I get all the work I have, done.
