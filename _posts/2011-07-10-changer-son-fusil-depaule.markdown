Sometimes, when all else fails, you have to change your tack.  

<!--more-->  

The Perl programming language is largely based on the idea that "there's more than one way to do it". This same idea can be applied to real-time embedded programming -- especially when the method of choice just doesn't seem to want to work. Coming to that conclusion sometimes takes a bit of time -- especially when you've been focusing on getting your first approach to work -- and may require input from a colleague. That can actually work even if the colleague in question doesn't know what you're talking about.




This morning, I had an idea for a problem I've been working to resolve. I wouldn't exactly call it an epiphany but it seemed to be the only solution still available -- namely to break the rules and try something that _should_ fail, but might actually work. When explaining the idea during a progress report, a completely different approach appeared on the whiteboard, in the drawing I was making.




That new approach, which took about an hour to implement, including the time to recompile CE, proved to be a very fruitful idea: it allowed me to answer the question I was trying to answer all along, and had a much lower chance at failing.




Once again hindsight is 20/20, but it sure would've been nice to think of this before...
