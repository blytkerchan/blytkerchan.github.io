It really surprises me sometimes how much you can have to explain about simple things.

<!--more-->

I've written quite a bit of code, most of which is in production today on systems ranging from huge servers tucked away in a bank's data center somewhere to tiny embedded devices that might just be hanging from your keychain. Most of that code is written in either C or C++, or some combination of the two and some of it contains from-scratch rewrites of things I'd written, often slightly differently, elsewhere.

So today, I decided to do another one of those rewrites, but for educational purposes. I'm not done yet, but I am amazed at how much I'll have to _explain_ about the code to make it all clear. The code in question (which is done - the explaining takes a lot longer) uses various techniques that aren't familiar to many programmers, which makes for even more explaining.

In all, I think I'll have several hundreds of words for maybe a hundred lines of code...

A picture is worth a thousand words - but how much is a class template worth?
