Happy new year!

2019 was an interesting year for many reasons, and I was lucky enough to finish it with family and friends in sunny Florida. 2020 also promises to be interesting, but being the nerd and nit-picker that I am, let me just rant about one minor detail...

**We did not start a new decade**: 2020 is the tenth year of the second decade of the twenty-first century of the common era. It is ***not*** the first year of any decade. As there was no year 0, centuries go from 1 to 100, so the current century started in the year 2001. The first decade ran from 2001 to 2010, the second started on January 1, 2011, and will finish on December 31, 2010.

This is by no means important, but I do get annoyed when people who should know better, like tech writers and engineers, get this wrong.

Anyway, happy tenth year of the second decade of the twenty-first century of the common era!
