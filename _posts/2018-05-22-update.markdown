Readers of this site may wonder what I've been doing for last six months, which is an unusually long hiatus for me to not write anything. The answer is: I've been busy.
<!--more-->
About nine months ago, I co-founded a new company called [Optimus Analysis](http://optimus-analysis.ca) and have been putting quite a bit of work into the proof of concept as well as working with my co-founder to find some financing. I've also been working on a research project triggered by the so-called ["PGP server hack"](http://rlc.vlinder.ca/blog/2017/03/police-hack-pgp-server-really/) which, though going slowly, is getting along fairly well and has the potential to create a competitor new communications network.

Add to this my day job, consulting work, standards-related with, and family life, I've been a bit too busy to update this site.

I'll try to write something interesting...
