Wow.

What else can I say? Two weeks ago, I said "thanks for listening" because there'd been 5000 downloads of the Podcast. Apparently, you went ahead and told all your friends and colleagues, so now the podcast has been downloaded another 9000 times - getting us from 5000 to 14000 in two weeks!

I am both honored and humbled by such a big audience. Thank you.

Now I'll get back to coding that socks server so I have something to show y'all in two weeks :D
