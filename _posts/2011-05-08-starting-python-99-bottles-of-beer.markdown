title: Starting Python - 99 bottles of beer
wordpress_id: 1384

After a brief discussion on the subject on StackOverflow chat, I've decided to try my hand at Python, using the on-line IDE at [Ideone.com](http://ideone.com).
[Here](https://ideone.com/ummB0) is my rendering of "99 bottles of beer" in Python...

<!--more-->

I must say I find it a bit of a strange language, and I still have my reserves as far as its use of white space goes. For example:

    bottles = 99
    while bottles >= 0 :
    	if bottles > 1:

why the colons after the `while` and `if` statements if the white space already delimits blocks? I can understand it for one-liners, but I would expect it to be unnecessary for block statements, if the indentation tells you where the block begins and ends..

There'll probably be other musings as I work my way through the language... Comments, suggestions, questions and answers are welcome as always (but, as always, will only be posted here if they add to the content).
