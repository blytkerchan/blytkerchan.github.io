This is an all-new server, but at the same address as before (git.vlinder.ca). Note, though, that as it's an all-new server, the server's SSH key has changed. If you were using SSH for any of your access to the server, there's a good chance that you will both have to register with the server again and that SSH will complain that the server key has changed. Remove the corresponding key from ~/.ssh/known_hosts and it will be fine.

If anything is missing, let me know.
