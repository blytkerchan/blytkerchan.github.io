I got a private comment asking me about the "seven years of experience" I talked about in [my previous post](/blog/2009/07/how-to-become-an-expert/). Let me explain what I do and do not count:

- I _**do**_ count the time I worked for MiniSAT, now defunct, in France, as _Directeur des Systemes d'information_ - a title far more pompous than the work I did, which was that of a network admin and team lead for a small team of Perl and PHP programmers;
- I _**do**_ count the time I worked for [Harvest](http://harvest.fr), in France, as _Ingenieur de Developpement C++_, where my job was to maintain a modular framework for their calculation engine while writing a new one and helping the rest of the team out with their C++ questions
- I **_do_** count my job with [Optel Vision](http://optelvision.com), in Quebec, where I have worked as an Programmer-Analyst, Analyst, Team Lead, Project/Program Manager and (now) Chief Software Architect
- I _**do**_ count my work with [Vlinder Software](http://vlinder.ca), which I run
- I _**do not**_ count my work with Real Life Systems, which is the previous incarnation of what Vlinder Software is now, but which was far more like a hobby than like real work.
- I _**do not**_ count my studies, nor any of the internships, research projects or other phytopathology-related work.

In much the same way, I do not often mention that I am a published poet, that I write fiction and that I study Christian theology. When I say "seven years of experience" I mean "seven years of making a living doing software engineering".
