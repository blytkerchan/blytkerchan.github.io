About two years ago, I posted on [this blog](https://rlc.vlinder.ca/blog/2024/08/11/learning-despite-ai), expressing a concern that has since only grown. The first cohort of students that had to learn their trade during this AI revolution that we're experiencing right now is starting to hit the job market, and it shows.

Interns and junior developers are at the "learning to read and write" stage of their professional development, and are being hindered in that development by demands of productivity that they cannot achieve, let alone sustain, without "help" from AI. The problem with that should be obvious: to effectively and safely use AI "assistants" like GitHub Copilot, you need to be better than the assistant: you need to understand that, for example, the mere presence of an authorization token doesn't mean the call is authorized, or that doing performance testing to see the effects of a data pruning operation on a UI's responsiveness only makes sense if the database being pruned is actually connected to that UI somehow.

[The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Human Thought](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.16628) by Rénald Gesnot highlights a variety of concerns, including the "standardization of thought", and "cognitive offloading" and the sedanterization that comes with it. (See also [Derga <i>et al.</i>: "<i>From tools to threats: a reflection on the impact of artificial-intelligence chatbots on cognitive health</i>"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11020077/)) Business leaders talk a great deal about innovation, and tend to put a lot of faith in AI to drive that innovation, but while AI itself is certainly an innovation in the sense that it is both novel and useful, using AI by plugging it into every part of every business process does not make a business innovative.

To continue innovating, especially in large businesses, companies need fresh ideas, new perspectives, and change agents to join their ranks. The generation of young developers joining the workforce today are supposed to be that zephyr of fresh air that, just strong enough to blow the dust away yet gentle enough to leave the old dogs soundly asleep, keeps the innovation oxygenated and alive. For that to work, though, they need to be allowed to learn, to train their brain rather than the model, and (most importantly) to make mistakes.

In conversations these last few weeks, the topic of AI and its role in software development and business management has often come up.

- automate using AI to allow the human to be the creative element
- train  young developers by making them intern in the QA/V&V part of the business
- pair young developers with seniors and have them review code and ask questions
- coach the seniors and incentivize them to be teachers
- have the younguns learn something difficult, *then* use AI to compare what they learned with what the assistant tells them, so they learn to understand the limits of the technology
