Hi there!

I'm Ronald Landheer-Cieslak.

Quick resume:

* Started my professional career developing in interactive television, back when I lived in Paris.
* Briefly worked for a mid-sized company making software for French banks, before emigrating to Canada.
* Worked in industrial automation and automated quality control for the pharmaceutical industry for a few years.
* Worked in SCADA and industrial automation for a decade or so.
* Now working in Cloud, bringing Cloud to an OT environment, and DevSecOps.

This is my blog. My other blog is [here](https://applied-paranoia.com).

For now, that's probably all you need to know.
